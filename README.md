## Project Description
The idea behind this project was to take an open-source project, find an inefficient user interaction, and fix it as we saw fit. After some research, we decided to work on 
[Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/en/). Kiwix is a non-profit organization aimed at providing access to educational material found online, for those
without internet access. Scrolling through Kiwix request forums showed us that many users were requestuing an undo button for closing a tab. We believed that this would be 
the perfect goal for this project.

## Environment
This project was developed using a virtual Linux Ubuntu environment. 
- Add more details here later about tools, frameworks, etc.

## Executing the Application
- Add a step-by-step guide on how to run our version of Kiwix
